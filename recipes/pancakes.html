    <h2>Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Very light and fluffy pancake that requires fresh buttermilk, The best ever!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Buttermilk. NO buttermilk? no problem! Buttermilk can be substituted with just regular milk and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Buttermilk Pancake Additions</h2>
    <p>Optional mix-ins include <em>chocolate chips,</em> <em>berries,</em> and <em>nuts</em>. You could also opt-in for cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for a little extra warmth. Instead of syrup, you could top your buttermilk pancakes with jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic.</p>
